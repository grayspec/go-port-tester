### Running the Application

#### Server (Test Subject)
The server component will host a simple HTTP service on specified ports for testing purposes.

```bash
./build/<platform>/server --config server.csv
```

#### Client (Port Tester)
The client component will send requests to specified IP and port combinations to check their status.

```bash
./build/<platform>/client --servers servers.csv --output result.csv --timeout 2 --concurrency 5
```

---

### Usage Examples

**Sample CSV for Servers** (`servers.csv`):
```csv
IP,Port
127.0.0.1,8080
192.168.1.10,8081
```
